1. Introduction

   DNC is a server on which connected clients will be able to 
   communicate between them through a TCP connection.

   It is very useful to make a secure conversation between clients
   and ensure an established connection based on TCP protocol.

   TCP is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a 
   network conversation by which applications can exchange data.



2. Basic operation

   Each connected client must have a unique nickname. if the nickname 
   already exists ,  the server will ask to choose another available 
   nickname. Once the nickname is accepted the server will notify all
   the connected clients that this client is now part of connected 
   clients. 

   Once the client is disconnected , the server will notify all the 
   connected clients that this client is now disconnected with the exact 
   time of disconnection.

   The connected clients can send messages to the server which is going
   to broadcast them to all the connected clients while showing the 
   nickname and the content of the message of the client who wrote the 
   message.

   A connected client can send a private message to another client as
   well as sending public messages.But  , In order to send a private 
   message the client needs to use the command TELL, and the command 
   CHAT for public messages.

   Before the connected client starts a private chat they need to use 
   the command SEND to be able to start the private chat
   and the other client can accept the request by responding using the
   same command SEND.

   The connected clients can send commands which are not case sensitive,
   they can also share files between them.

                                    DNC                    February 2022



   Once the receiver accepts the file, they both need to agree on which
   port and the protocol(UDP/TCP) to use.

   The server replies should be followed by response code in order to
   show the clients that their command is accepted or not.
